# Module 4 Challenge Assignment : Risk Return Analysis

 Goal of this assignment is to -
 1. Read historical trade data from CSV files (daily NAVs or prices of various fund portfolios and S&P 500 index)
 2. Convert to daily returns for further analysis.
 3. Analyse the daily returns #
     3.1 Visualize the daily returns, cumulative returns to observe patterns
     3.2 Use box plots to analyse volatilty of return data 
     3.3 Analyse standard deviation, rolling window standard deviation to understand nature of risk
     3.4 Use sharpe ratios to analyse risk-return dynamic
     3.5 Use variance, coveriance and betas to diversify the portfolio (select portfolio that looks most attractive)

Program uses 'Pandas' library to work with dataframes and analyse timeseries data. Program mainly focuses on .loc function to narrow down timeseries and extensively uses visualization techniques to perform analysis.

Program also imports from Path and CSV libraries to read data from the file.
